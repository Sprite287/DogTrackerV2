## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All status badges and empty states now follow the same visual pattern
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to badge styles or empty state designs can be made in one place
3. **Flexibility**: The partials support various parameters for customization
4. **Code Reduction**: Eliminated duplicate HTML across templates
5. **Future-proof**: Easy to add new badge types or empty state variations

## Remaining Considerations

1. The JavaScript code in `staff_management.html` still creates badges inline - consider creating a JavaScript function that generates the same HTML structure as the partial
2. Some templates may still have inline badge HTML in modals or JavaScript-generated content
3. Consider adding documentation for the partial parameters to help other developers use them correctly
