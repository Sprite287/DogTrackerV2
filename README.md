## 3. Project Setup & Installation

### 3.1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL server installed and running
- `pip` and `virtualenv` (or `venv`)

### 3.2. Initial Setup

**1. Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd DogTrackerV2
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date with all necessary packages: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, psycopg2-binary, etc.)*

**4. Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root (DogTrackerV2) or set system environment variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://doguser:dogpassword@localhost:5432/dogtracker"
SECRET_KEY="a_very_secret_random_key_for_sessions"
FLASK_APP="app" # Or your app entry point
FLASK_DEBUG="True" # For development
```

- **`DATABASE_URL`**: Update with your PostgreSQL connection details (user, password, host, port, database name)
- **`SECRET_KEY`**: Generate a strong, random secret key

**5. Create the Database (if it doesn't exist):**

Connect to your PostgreSQL server and create the database specified in `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `dogtracker`).
```sql
-- Example psql command
CREATE DATABASE dogtracker;
CREATE USER doguser WITH PASSWORD 'dogpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dogtracker TO doguser;
```

**6. Initialize Database and Run Migrations:**
```bash
flask db init  # Only if you haven't initialized migrations before
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration" # Or a descriptive message
flask db upgrade
```

**7. Populate Initial Data (Optional but Recommended):**

If you have a script like `populate_dogs.py` or similar for seeding initial data:
```bash
python populate_dogs.py # Or flask <command_name> if it's a CLI command
```

### 3.3. Running the Application

**1. Activate Virtual Environment (if not already active):**
```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

**2. Run the Flask Development Server:**

The project includes batch files for convenience:
- `start_server.bat` (Windows)

Alternatively, use the Flask CLI:
```bash
flask run
```

The application should typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### **Phase 6: Multi-Tenancy, Security & Core Audit (IN PROGRESS)**

*   **Objective:** Adapt the application to support multiple independent rescue organizations, implement robust security measures, ensure data privacy, controlled access, and establish a comprehensive audit trail for critical operations.

*   **Key Deliverables & Sub-Phases:**

    *   **6A: Foundation - Audit System & Authentication Infrastructure**
        *   **6A.1: Comprehensive Audit System (Foundational - Implemented First) ✅**
            *   **Status:** Complete. All audit logging, batching, compression, cleanup, admin UI, and superadmin tools implemented.
            *   **Audit Log Model:** `AuditLog` model (`timestamp`, `user_id`, `rescue_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `action`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `details` (JSON), `success`, `error_message`, `execution_time`, `occurrence_count`, `last_occurrence`).
            *   **Scope:** Audit every dog action (create, edit, delete, view), user logins (success/failure), role changes, data exports, critical deletions (appointments, medicines), rescue registration/status changes.
            *   **Optimization Strategies:**
                *   **Async Logging with Batching:** Use a background thread and queue (`AuditBatcher`) to batch DB writes (e.g., batch size 50, flush interval 30s). Bulk inserts.
                *   **Smart Compression (Consider for Future):** For high-frequency, low-importance events (e.g., views), compress similar consecutive events (e.g., within a 5-min window).
                *   **Database Optimizations:** Partition `audit_log` table (e.g., by month). Optimized composite and partial indexes.
                *   **Audit Context Manager:** For bulk operations, log a single parent audit event with multiple sub-actions.
                *   **Optimized Audit Viewing:** Use DB-level pagination, selective column retrieval for list views, load full details on demand.
            *   **Audit Aging & Cleanup:**
                *   Policy for compressing/archiving/deleting old audit logs (e.g., compress details after 90 days, archive non-critical after 1 year, delete after 2-5 years based on criticality).
                *   Separate archival storage for deleted/archived rescue audit logs.
            *   **Performance Monitoring:** Basic metrics for audit system (batch sizes, flush times).
        *   **6A.2: Authentication System & Rescue Self-Registration ✅**
            *   **Status:** Complete. Full authentication system with Flask-Login, rescue self-registration, and comprehensive security measures implemented.
            *   **Database Schema Enhancements (User Model):** Added `password_hash`, `email` (unique), `is_active`, `created_at`, `last_login`, `email_verified`, `data_consent`, `marketing_consent`. ✅
            *   **Authentication Library Integration:** Flask-Login for session management, `werkzeug.security` for password hashing. ✅
            *   **Core Authentication Routes & UI:** `/login`, `/logout`, `/register-rescue`, `/password-reset-request`, `/password-reset/<token>` routes with professional Bootstrap 5 templates. ✅
            *   **Rescue Self-Registration Workflow:** ✅
                *   Complete rescue registration with primary contact setup. ✅
                *   Comprehensive form validation with Flask-WTF. ✅
                *   **Duplicate Prevention:** ✅
                    *   Exact name match check (blocks registration). ✅
                    *   Fuzzy name matching (~85% similarity using `difflib`) with validation errors. ✅
                    *   Contact email/phone cross-check (blocks if already registered). ✅
                *   New rescues start in "pending" state, requiring superadmin approval. ✅
                *   First user of rescue becomes 'admin' with `is_first_user` flag. ✅
            *   **Password Policy:** Enforced strong passwords (4+ characters, letter + number) with regex validation. ✅
            *   **Security Features:** CSRF protection, secure session management, password reset tokens with expiration. ✅
            *   **Audit Integration:** All authentication events (login/logout, registrations, password resets) logged through audit system. ✅
            *   **Multi-tenancy Foundation:** Data filtering by `current_user.rescue_id`, navigation updates, user role management. ✅

    *   **6B: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation & Management**
        *   **Rescue Association & Query Filtering:** Enforce `rescue_id` on all relevant models. Modify ALL database queries to filter by `current_user.rescue_id`. Implement helper functions for consistent filtering.
        *   **Ownership Verification:** Ensure users only access/modify their own rescue's resources. Return 403/404 for unauthorized access.
        *   **Medicine Management (Hybrid System):**
            *   `MedicinePreset` to have `is_global` and `created_by_rescue_id` fields.
            *   `RescueMedicineActivation` junction table (`rescue_id`, `medicine_preset_id`, `is_active`, `activated_at`, `deactivated_at`, `deactivated_by`, `reactivated_at`, `reactivated_by`).
            *   New rescues start with an empty medicine list but can activate global medicines or create custom ones.
            *   **Medicine Deactivation:** Soft deactivation (`is_active = False` in `RescueMedicineActivation`). Deactivated medicines are hidden from new prescriptions but preserved in existing records. Admins can reactivate from their admin page.
        *   **Appointment Types:** Global standard types. Customization via notes.
        *   **Audit Integration:** All multi-tenancy operations (rescue creation, data access, ownership verification failures) are logged through the audit system.

    *   **6C: Authorization & Permissions (Initial Scope)**
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Utilize existing `User.role` ('admin', 'staff' per rescue). Admins have full control within their rescue; staff have limited (e.g., no deletion of critical items, no user management).
        *   Implement permission checks (e.g., decorators) for critical actions. UI elements dynamically show/hide based on permissions.
        *   **Audit Integration:** All authorization decisions and permission changes are logged through the audit system.

    *   **6D: Security Hardening (Core)**
        *   **CSRF Protection:** Integrate Flask-WTF for all forms. Ensure HTMX compatibility (e.g., JS to fetch and add CSRF token to HTMX requests).
        *   **Session Security:** Secure cookie flags (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'`), session timeout.
        *   **Input Sanitization & Validation:** Review all user inputs for server-side validation. Ensure XSS protection.
        *   **Basic Security Headers:** `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** For login attempts and sensitive API endpoints.
        *   **Audit Integration:** All security events (failed login attempts, CSRF violations, rate limiting triggers) are logged through the audit system.

*   **Testing Strategy for Phase 6:**
    *   Extensive multi-rescue setup. Verify data isolation. Test permission scenarios. Validate CSRF and other security measures. Basic penetration testing.
