# DogTrackerV2 - Dog Rescue Management Application

## 1. Project Overview

DogTrackerV2 is a web application designed to help dog rescue organizations manage their dogs, including tracking their status, medical information, appointments, and medication schedules. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for staff and volunteers to efficiently manage rescue operations and ensure the well-being of the animals in their care.

The system features robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for dogs, appointments, and medicines, utilizing modern web technologies like Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTMX, and Bootstrap to deliver a responsive and dynamic user experience without requiring full page reloads for most interactions.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Flask (Python)
    *   **Database ORM:** SQLAlchemy
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL (default, configurable via `DATABASE_URL`)

    *   Python 3.x
    *   `pip` for package management (`requirements.txt`)
    *   Virtual environment (e.g., `venv`)

## 3. Project Setup & Installation

### 3.1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PostgreSQL server installed and running.
*   `pip` and `virtualenv` (or `venv`)

### 3.2. Initial Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd DogTrackerV2
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date with all necessary packages: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, psycopg2-binary, etc.)*

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root (DogTrackerV2) or set system environment variables:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://doguser:dogpassword@localhost:5432/dogtracker"
    SECRET_KEY="a_very_secret_random_key_for_sessions"
    FLASK_APP="app" # Or your app entry point
    FLASK_DEBUG="True" # For development
    ```
    *   **`DATABASE_URL`**: Update with your PostgreSQL connection details (user, password, host, port, database name).
    *   **`SECRET_KEY`**: Generate a strong, random secret key.

5.  **Create the Database (if it doesn't exist):**
    Connect to your PostgreSQL server and create the database specified in `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `dogtracker`).
    ```sql
    -- Example psql command
    CREATE DATABASE dogtracker;
    CREATE USER doguser WITH PASSWORD 'dogpassword';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dogtracker TO doguser;
    ```

6.  **Initialize Database and Run Migrations:**
    ```bash
    flask db init  # Only if you haven't initialized migrations before
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration" # Or a descriptive message
    flask db upgrade
    ```

7.  **Populate Initial Data (Optional but Recommended):**
    If you have a script like `populate_dogs.py` or similar for seeding initial data (e.g., appointment types, medicine presets, admin users, sample dogs):
    ```bash
    python populate_dogs.py # Or flask <command_name> if it's a CLI command
    ```

### 3.3. Running the Application

1.  **Activate Virtual Environment (if not already active):**
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Run the Flask Development Server:**
    The project includes batch files for convenience:
    *   `start_server.bat` (Windows)
    Alternatively, use the Flask CLI:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application should typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

        *   Implement logic to restrict access to CRUD operations and specific data views based on user role and their affiliated rescue.
        *   Consider using Flask-Principal or similar for role management.
    *   **Rescue Privacy (Data Isolation / Multi-Tenancy):**
        *   Ensure `Rescue` model is fully utilized.
        *   Update all database models (Dog, Appointment, Medicine, etc.) to have a mandatory `rescue_id` foreign key.
        *   Modify **all** database queries (SQLAlchemy) to filter by the `current_user.rescue_id` to ensure users from one rescue cannot see or modify data from another. This is critical and affects nearly all routes.
        *   Develop a mechanism for super-admin to manage rescues, or for rescues to sign up (if applicable).
    *   **Public Welcome/Landing Page:**
        *   Create a page for unauthenticated users providing an overview of the application, and leading to login/registration portals.
    *   **Security Hardening:**
        *   Thorough review for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF - ensure forms have CSRF protection if not already handled by Flask-WTF or similar, SQL Injection - SQLAlchemy provides good protection but review custom query constructs).
        *   Ensure consistent and proper input sanitization for all user-provided data.
        *   Review and enhance session management security (e.g., secure cookie flags, session timeout).
        *   Implement rate limiting for login attempts and sensitive API endpoints.
        *   Review file upload security if that feature is added later.
    *   **Usability Testing:** Conduct informal usability tests to identify pain points and areas for improvement in workflows.

### **Phase 7: UI/UX Polish & Finalization (PLANNED)**

*   **Objective:** Refine the user interface and user experience for a polished, professional, and highly usable application.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   **Personalized Authenticated Welcome Screen:**
        *   Create an initial screen for logged-in users after authentication.
        *   Display a personalized welcome message incorporating their rescue organization's name.
        *   Include an engaging animated button that links to the "Central Home Page / Dashboard".
    *   **Responsive Navigation System:**
        *   Implement a main application navigation system.
        *   For mobile and tablet views: Use a hamburger menu icon on the left to toggle navigation.
        *   For desktop/laptop views: Use a persistent sidebar navigation on the left.
    *   **Consistent Styling & Layout:** Review all pages for visual consistency, adherence to Bootstrap best practices, and appealing design.
    *   **Enhanced Error Handling & User Feedback:**
        *   Implement detailed, user-friendly, in-modal error messages for all form validation failures (revisiting the `modal_form_error.html` concept and applying it thoroughly).
        *   Consider client-side validation hints in addition to server-side validation.
        *   Improve global alert/notification system for clarity and user guidance.
    *   **Accessibility (A11y):** Review application against WCAG guidelines (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes for dynamic content, color contrast).
    *   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Thoroughly test and refine layouts on various screen sizes (phones, tablets).
    *   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test on major modern browsers.
    *   **Branding:** Incorporate rescue-specific branding elements if multi-tenancy is implemented (e.g., logo display). Add a general favicon.
    *   **Final Usability Review:** Conduct a final round of usability testing across the polished application.
*   **Recommended Tools & Approaches for Polish:**
    *   **Theming/Inspiration:** Explore Bootswatch (or similar) themes for initial visual direction or inspiration.
    *   **Iconography:** Integrate a comprehensive icon library (e.g., Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome) for clear visual communication.
    *   **Typography:** Utilize Google Fonts (or similar services) for refined and web-optimized typography.
    *   **Animations:** Employ CSS Animations & Transitions for most UI enhancements. Consider LottieFiles for complex vector animations on key interactive elements (e.g., animated welcome button).
    *   **Styling Foundation:** Leverage Bootstrap 5 as the base, with extensive custom CSS to tailor the appearance, ensuring a unique and cohesive design.

### **Phase 8: System Testing & Stabilization (PLANNED)**

*   **Objective:** Conduct comprehensive testing of the application to ensure stability, identify and fix bugs, and verify all features before preparing for deployment.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   **End-to-End Feature Testing:** Thoroughly test all user stories and functional requirements across the entire application.
    *   **Integration Testing:** Verify that different modules and components work together correctly.
    *   **Bug Fixing:** Prioritize and address issues identified during testing.
    *   **Performance & Stability Checks:** Basic checks to ensure the application performs adequately under normal load and remains stable.
    *   **Cross-Browser & Responsiveness Re-validation:** Final checks on major browsers and device sizes after all features and UI polish are in place.

### **Phase 9: Deployment Preparation & Launch (PLANNED)**

*   **Objective:** Prepare the application for a production environment and deploy it.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   **Production Configuration:**
        *   Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False`.
        *   Use a production-grade WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, Waitress).
        *   Manage sensitive configurations (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`) securely via environment variables or a configuration management system, not hardcoded.
    *   **Static File Handling:** Optimize serving of static files (e.g., using WhiteNoise if not using a dedicated web server like Nginx for static assets).
    *   **Database:**
        *   Set up a production PostgreSQL database instance.
        *   Ensure migrations are up-to-date and can be applied to the production DB.
        *   Plan for database backups.
    *   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement robust logging for errors and important events in production. Set up basic application monitoring.
    *   **HTTPS:** Ensure the application is served over HTTPS in production (e.g., via a reverse proxy like Nginx with Let's Encrypt).
    *   **Testing:** Perform final end-to-end testing in a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   **Deployment:** Deploy to the chosen hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, PythonAnywhere).
