## Blueprint Refactoring Phases & Implementation Plan

---

### **Phase R1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure ⚠️ PLANNED**

**Objective:** Establish blueprint architecture foundation and extract critical shared infrastructure without breaking existing functionality. Focus on low-risk infrastructure moves.

**Key Deliverables:**

**Directory Structure & Blueprint Foundation:**
- Create complete `blueprints/` directory structure with all subdirectories
- Create `core/` folder for shared utilities, decorators, and infrastructure
- Add all necessary `__init__.py` files for proper Python module structure
- Create empty blueprint skeleton files with basic registration structure

**Core Infrastructure Extraction:**
- **Move Error Handlers to `core/errors.py`:**
  - `@app.errorhandler(404)` and `@app.errorhandler(500)`
  - Error logging integration with audit system
  - Template rendering for error pages
  
- **Create `core/decorators.py` (CRITICAL):**
  - `@roles_required` decorator with audit integration
  - `@rescue_access_required` decorator with complex lambda support
  - `@role_required` wrapper utility
  - Permission denial logging and 403 handling
  
- **Create `core/utils.py`:**
  - Shared helper functions (`get_rescue_dogs`, `get_rescue_appointments`, etc.)
  - Multi-tenant data filtering functions
  - HTMX response helpers and flash message utilities
  - Common query builders and validation logic

**Audit System Preparation:**
- **Create `core/audit_helpers.py`:**
