### **Phase 6: Multi-Tenancy, Security & Core Audit (IN PROGRESS)**

*   **Objective:** Adapt the application to support multiple independent rescue organizations, implement robust security measures, ensure data privacy, controlled access, and establish a comprehensive audit trail for critical operations.

*   **Key Deliverables & Sub-Phases:**

    *   **6A: Foundation - Audit System & Authentication Infrastructure**
        *   **6A.1: Comprehensive Audit System (Foundational - Implemented First) ✅**
            *   **Status:** Complete. All audit logging, batching, compression, cleanup, admin UI, and superadmin tools implemented.
            *   **Audit Log Model:** `AuditLog` model (`timestamp`, `user_id`, `rescue_id`, `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `action`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `details` (JSON), `success`, `error_message`, `execution_time`, `occurrence_count`, `last_occurrence`).
            *   **Scope:** Audit every dog action (create, edit, delete, view), user logins (success/failure), role changes, data exports, critical deletions (appointments, medicines), rescue registration/status changes.
            *   **Optimization Strategies:**
                *   **Async Logging with Batching:** Use a background thread and queue (`AuditBatcher`) to batch DB writes (e.g., batch size 50, flush interval 30s). Bulk inserts.
                *   **Smart Compression (Consider for Future):** For high-frequency, low-importance events (e.g., views), compress similar consecutive events (e.g., within a 5-min window).
                *   **Database Optimizations:** Partition `audit_log` table (e.g., by month). Optimized composite and partial indexes.
                *   **Audit Context Manager:** For bulk operations, log a single parent audit event with multiple sub-actions.
                *   **Optimized Audit Viewing:** Use DB-level pagination, selective column retrieval for list views, load full details on demand.
            *   **Audit Aging & Cleanup:**
                *   Policy for compressing/archiving/deleting old audit logs (e.g., compress details after 90 days, archive non-critical after 1 year, delete after 2-5 years based on criticality).
                *   Separate archival storage for deleted/archived rescue audit logs.
            *   **Performance Monitoring:** Basic metrics for audit system (batch sizes, flush times).
        *   **6A.2: Authentication System & Rescue Self-Registration ✅**
            *   **Status:** Complete. Full authentication system with Flask-Login, rescue self-registration, and comprehensive security measures implemented.
            *   **Database Schema Enhancements (User Model):** Added `password_hash`, `email` (unique), `is_active`, `created_at`, `last_login`, `email_verified`, `data_consent`, `marketing_consent`. ✅
            *   **Authentication Library Integration:** Flask-Login for session management, `werkzeug.security` for password hashing. ✅
            *   **Core Authentication Routes & UI:** `/login`, `/logout`, `/register-rescue`, `/password-reset-request`, `/password-reset/<token>` routes with professional Bootstrap 5 templates. ✅
            *   **Rescue Self-Registration Workflow:** ✅
                *   Complete rescue registration with primary contact setup. ✅
                *   Comprehensive form validation with Flask-WTF. ✅
                *   **Duplicate Prevention:** ✅
                    *   Exact name match check (blocks registration). ✅
                    *   Fuzzy name matching (~85% similarity using `difflib`) with validation errors. ✅
                    *   Contact email/phone cross-check (blocks if already registered). ✅
                *   New rescues start in "pending" state, requiring superadmin approval. ✅
                *   First user of rescue becomes 'admin' with `is_first_user` flag. ✅
            *   **Password Policy:** Enforced strong passwords (4+ characters, letter + number) with regex validation. ✅
            *   **Security Features:** CSRF protection, secure session management, password reset tokens with expiration. ✅
            *   **Audit Integration:** All authentication events (login/logout, registrations, password resets) logged through audit system. ✅
            *   **Multi-tenancy Foundation:** Data filtering by `current_user.rescue_id`, navigation updates, user role management. ✅

    *   **6B: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation & Hybrid Medicine Management**
        *   All data models (dogs, appointments, medicines, reminders, medicine presets) are rescue-aware and support both global and rescue-specific data. ✅
        *   All queries and routes are filtered and protected by rescue ownership; superadmins can access all data. ✅
        *   Medicine Preset Management:
            *   Rescue admins can create, edit, and delete their own rescue's medicine presets (not visible to other rescues). ✅
            *   Rescue admins can activate or deactivate (toggle) both global and their own rescue-specific medicine presets for their rescue. ✅
            *   Presets are active by default; deactivation is explicit and stored. Unchecking disables a preset for the rescue. ✅
            *   The "Manage Medicines" UI groups presets by category in an accordion for easy navigation. ✅
        *   Audit/History:
            *   Every activation or deactivation of a medicine preset is audit-logged, including who did it, which preset, which rescue, and the action (activate/deactivate). ✅
            *   These events are visible in the Audit Logs for full traceability. ✅

        *   Phase 6B is now fully implemented, providing robust multi-tenant data isolation, hybrid medicine management, and traceability for all medicine-related actions. ✅

    *   **6C: Authorization & Permissions (RBAC) & Staff Management ✅ COMPLETED**
        *   **Objective:** Implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and a full-featured staff management UI. ✅

        **Key Deliverables:**
        - Centralized permission decorators for roles and rescue access (`permissions.py`). ✅
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Utilize existing `User.role` ('admin', 'staff' per rescue). Admins have full control within their rescue; staff have limited (e.g., no deletion of critical items, no user management). ✅
        *   Implement permission checks (e.g., decorators) for critical actions. UI elements dynamically show/hide based on permissions. ✅
        *   **Audit Integration:** All authorization decisions and permission changes are logged through the audit system. ✅

    *   **6D: Security Hardening (Core)**
        *   **CSRF Protection:** Integrate Flask-WTF for all forms. Ensure HTMX compatibility (e.g., JS to fetch and add CSRF token to HTMX requests).
        *   **Session Security:** Secure cookie flags (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax'`), session timeout.
        *   **Input Sanitization & Validation:** Review all user inputs for server-side validation. Ensure XSS protection.
        *   **Basic Security Headers:** `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** For login attempts and sensitive API endpoints.
        *   **Audit Integration:** All security events (failed login attempts, CSRF violations, rate limiting triggers) are logged through the audit system.

*   **Testing Strategy for Phase 6:**
    *   Extensive multi-rescue setup. Verify data isolation. Test permission scenarios. Validate CSRF and other security measures. Basic penetration testing.

### **Phase 10: Ultimate Multi-Tenancy & Scalability (PLANNED)**

*   **Objective:** Implement advanced database-level multi-tenancy for maximum data isolation and prepare the application for large-scale deployment and high traffic.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   **Database Row-Level Security (RLS):**
        *   Transition from query-level filtering to PostgreSQL (or chosen DB) Row-Level Security policies.
        *   Ensures data isolation is enforced at the database layer, reducing application-level risk.
    *   **Advanced Scalability Enhancements (As Needed):**
        *   Review application performance under load.
        *   Identify and optimize bottlenecks.
        *   Consider options like:
            *   Read replicas for the database.
            *   Caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
            *   Asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery) for long-running background jobs beyond audit logging.
            *   Potential refactoring of specific components into microservices if justified by complexity and load.
    *   **Advanced Monitoring & Alerting:**
        *   Integrate comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM) tools.
        *   Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, and security events.
